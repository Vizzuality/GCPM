        <h2 class="-underlined -mg-top">What is the Global Oncology (GO) Map?</h2>
        <p>The Global Oncology (GO) Map is an interactive online tool and public resource for the global cancer community. Its purpose is to help the cancer control community initiate partnerships, make informed decisions, and develop collaborations. The GO Map catalogs international Projects and Events related to cancer research, care, and outreach, and displays them in a searchable format.</p>

        <h2 class="-underlined -mg-top">What are a “Project” and an “Event” on the GO Map?</h2>
        <p>A <strong>Project</strong> on the GO Map is any cancer research or control activity involving collaboration between individuals or organizations: a) in two or more countries, b) in one or more low‐ or middle‐income countries, or c) with evidence of focus on or benefit to underserved populations in any country, with or without international collaboration.</p>
        <p>The focus of a project may be in the area(s) of prevention, early detection, pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, survivorship, palliative care, or supportive care. A project may include research projects, cancer control programs, and/or training and capacity building.</p>
        <p>An <strong>Event</strong> is a short-term project, usually lasting somewhere from a few hours to a few days. Conferences, workshops, webinars, fellowships, and other training meetings are all examples of Events.</p>
